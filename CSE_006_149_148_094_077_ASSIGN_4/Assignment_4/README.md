Assignment 4:

We tried the codes in HPC IT Lab first. Since we had to wait for a long time over there, we decided to use Super Computer for the same. The codes were run in separate tmux terminals, mostly at night or at times when the usage of super computer was low and threads were idle.

The codes were pretty simple and straight-forward. We just had to modify and add few lines of code to the codes provided to us via mail.

Each Problem has a script file to run. Executing that would generate .dat files.

`sh run.sh`

The outputs are provided in the respective folders!

There is a python script attached which uses matplotlib to plot the outputs. !
